### Yo! 👋

Yep, I'm using a theme that looks exactly like GitHub's! I stumbled upon it while [browsing Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/github-style/). I figured since I spend a lot of time browsing GitHub, I'd use it! I had to make quite a few modifications to the original theme so that it would be more academic oriented. Even reached out to GitHub folks early January (2021) to get the ok (*never heard back though >.>*), so here we are! Now with that out the way...

Welcome and thank you for stopping by! I'm Robert Petit (*puh-teet, not pet-it*), and I currently work as a bioinformatician with [Theiagen Genomics](https://theiagen.com/) at the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory. My work involves building up the bioinfomatic capacity for WPHL and facilitating bioinformatic training. In my personal time I am continuing to develop [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), a bacterial genome analysis pipeline.
