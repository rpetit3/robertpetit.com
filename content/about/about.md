You made it here! Hmmmm, where to start? Well, you probably figured out by now, I'm Robert Petit. But did you know I was born in the Philippines? And, I grew up in the military (Air Force)? Since we moved a lot, its kind of hard to point at a location and say *"this is where I‚Äôm from"*. But, if I had to pick one I would say Georgia (USA), considering I've lived here more than 20 years!

I completed my undergrad at [Valdosta State University](https://www.valdosta.edu/) in Biology, somehow during this time I was able to change my major 6 times, it was quite the adventure! I did meet my wife during one of those majors (middle grades education), so it all worked out! I then wound up in Atlanta, Georgia for [Georgia Tech's the Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu/) graduate program. Honestly, the first semester was a bit rough and I was on the verge of calling it quits. Luckily, I was introduced to Dr. Tim Read and a great partnership was formed! I would join Tim's lab as a bioinformatician and soon after joined the [Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution (PBEE)](https://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html) program at Emory University for my PhD. During my PhD I had the opportunity to work on some really exciting projects including the [Whale Shark genome](/publication/2017-whale-shark-draft-genome/), [MRSA transmission within households](/publication/2015-usa300-chicago/), [*Bacillus anthracis* typing](/publication/2018-bacillus-anthracis/), and [Staphopia](/publication/2018-staphopia/). Soon after completing my PhD, I took Staphopia to the next level and expanded to all bacteria with the development of [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/). Currently, I'm in the great state of Wyoming helping the [Wyoming Public Health Laboratory](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/lab/) build up their bioinformatics capacity.

When I‚Äôm not battling imposter syndrome, I do in fact do have a life (*yes, I've been asked if I have a life in a meeting ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è*). I love spending time with my family! Haha my kids are getting to the age where we can be trouble makers together! I enjoy reading YA fiction, light novels, web novels, comics/mangas, etc... Some of favorites include One Piece, DanMachi, Solo Leveling, Percy Jackson, Lemony Snicket, honestly so many others! I'm also somewhat handy, so usually my wife and I are working on fun little wood working projects.


## Education
üéì **Doctor of Philosophy**  
*[Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html), Emory University, 2018*  

My PhD was with with [Dr. Timothy Read](https://med.emory.edu/directory/profile/?u=TREAD) and focused on bacterial genomic analysis. It's honestly amazing how rapidly the field changed from my start (2013) and my finish (2018) of my PhD. During this time, I helped in a lot of projects, but my dissertation chapters included [*Staphylococcus aureus* viewed from the perspective of 40,000+ genomes](/publication/2018-staphopia/) (Staphopia), [Fine-scale differentiation between *Bacillus anthracis* and *Bacillus cereus* group signatures in metagenome shotgun data](/publication/2018-bacillus-anthracis/), and an unpublished review on barriers to horizontal gene transfer in *Staphylococcus aureus*.

üéì **Master of Science**  
*[Bioinformatics](https://bioinformatics.gatech.edu/), Georgia Institute of Technology, 2011*  

During my masters I worked with [Dr. Timothy Read](https://med.emory.edu/directory/profile/?u=TREAD) and [Dr. King Jordan](https://biosciences.gatech.edu/people/king-jordan) on the *very* (*very very*) early stages of [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu). I also submitted annotations to GenBank, which were critical for a genome announcement [publication](/publication/2011-hhaemolyticus/). This might not seem like much now, but in 2011 saying you successfully submitted annotations to GenBank in less than a month was actually something to brag about! ([Lee Katz](https://twitter.com/lskatz) will vouch for me!)

üéì **Bachelor of Science**  
*[Biology](https://www.valdosta.edu/biology/), Valdosta State University, 2010*  

Undergrad, was an adventure. I changed my major a lot, but hovered around Education, Computer Science and Biology. Favorite classes were probably Ecology and Botany (*I have a green thumb!*). I spent a summer helping [Dr. Colleen McDonough](https://www.valdosta.edu/biology/faculty-staff/colleen-mcdonough.php) catch and tag nine-banded armadillos for her behavioral ecology studies. 

## Professional Experience

üõ†Ô∏è **Senior Bioinformatics Scientist**  
*Wyoming Public Health Laboratory, Cheyenne, WY, 2021-present*  

I am developing the bioinformatics capacity for [Wyoming Public Health Laboratory](https://health.wyo.gov/publichealth/lab/) and facilitating bioinformatic training.

üõ†Ô∏è **Senior Data Analyst**  
*Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 2018-2021*  
  
I worked as a bioinformatician in Tim Read's lab, but also the [Georgia Emerging Infections Program](https://dph.georgia.gov/EIP). Much of my work involved developing [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), working on my own projects, providing support for the lab, and maintaining those servers.

üõ†Ô∏è **Information Analyst III**  
*Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 2011‚Äì2013*  

I worked as a bioinformatician in Tim Read's lab, where I developed protocols to streamline the analysis of bacterial sequencing projects locally and on Amazon Web Services. I worked on collaborative projects with other Emory researchers, Centers for Disease Control, Georgia Aquarium and University of Chicago. I also took on the role of lab meetings organizer and maintained multiple Unix servers critical to the group.

üõ†Ô∏è **Network and Systems Administrator**  
*Total Technology Integrators, Valdosta, GA, 2005‚Äì2010*  

I joined as a part-time IT Technician and progressed to a Network and Systems Administrator. In this position I helped manage the recommendation, installation, and ongoing maintenance of IT related infrastructure for several local companies. I also developed software to help monitor infrastructure and standardized protocols to improve job turn-around times.
