abstract = "*Staphylococcus aureus* is a prominent nosocomial pathogen that causes several life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia and bacteremia. *S. aureus* modulates the expression of its arsenal of virulence factors through sensing and integrating responses to environmental signals. The *agr* (accessory gene regulator) quorum sensing (QS) system is a major regulator of virulence phenotypes in *S. aureus*. There are four *agr* specificity groups each with a different autoinducer peptide sequence encoded by the *agrD* gene. Although *agr* is critical for the expression of many toxins, paradoxically, *S. aureus* strains often have nonfunctional *agr* activity due to loss-of-function mutations in the four-gene *agr* operon. To understand patterns in *agr* variability across *S. aureus*, we undertook a species-wide genomic investigation. We developed a software tool (AgrVATE; https://github.com/VishnuRaghuram94/AgrVATE) for typing and detecting frameshift mutations in the *agr* operon. In an analysis of over 40,000 *S. aureus* genomes, we showed a close association between *agr* type and *S. aureus* clonal complex. We also found a strong linkage between *agrBDC* alleles (encoding the peptidase, autoinducing peptide itself, and peptide sensor, respectively) but not *agrA* (encoding the response regulator). More than 5% of the genomes were found to have frameshift mutations in the *agr* operon. While 52% of these frameshifts occurred only once in the entire species, we observed cases where the recurring mutations evolved convergently across different clonal lineages with no evidence of long-term phylogenetic transmission, suggesting that strains with *agr* frameshifts were evolutionarily short-lived. Overall, genomic analysis of *agr* operon suggests evolution through multiple processes with functional consequences that are not fully understood."
