abstract = "*Staphylococcus aureus* is a major cause of bacteremia and other hospital-acquired infections. The cell-wall active antibiotic vancomycin is commonly used to treat both methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and sensitive (MSSA) infections. Vancomycin intermediate *S. aureus* (VISA) variants can arise through de novo mutations. Here, we performed pilot experiments to develop a combined PCR/long-read sequencing-based method for detection of previously known VISA-causing mutations. Primers were designed to generate 10 amplicons covering 16 genes associated with the VISA phenotype. We sequenced amplicon pools as long reads with Oxford Nanopore adapter ligation on Flongle flow cells. We then detected mutations by mapping reads against a parental consensus or known reference sequence and comparing called variants against a database of known VISA mutations from laboratory selection. Each amplicon in the pool was sequenced to high (>1,000Ã—) coverage, and no relationship was found between amplicon length and coverage. We also were able to detect the causative mutation (walK 646C>G) in a VISA mutant derived from the USA300 strain (N384-3 from parental strain N384). Mixing mutant (N384-3) and parental (N384) DNA at various ratios from 0 to 1 mutant suggested a mutation detection threshold of the average minor allele frequency (6.5%) at 95% confidence (two standard errors above mean mutation frequency). The study lays the groundwork for direct *S. aureus* antibiotic resistance genotype inference using rapid nanopore sequencing from clinical samples."
